- Recovery options provided for retryable errors:
  - API rate limiting with retry functionality
  - Network errors with fallback options
  - File system errors with recovery suggestions
- Error context includes operation details for debugging
- Integration with ErrorBoundary for crash prevention

**Verification**:
- AI service errors display in existing error notification UI
- Retry and recovery options work correctly
- Error logging integrates with existing error management
- Integration tests verify error handling flows

### ✅ 5. ShortformEvaluatorService Integration

**Requirement**: Ensure generated multi-question katas work with ShortformEvaluatorService

**Implementation**:
- Generated multi-question assessments use compatible submission format
- ShortformEvaluatorService evaluates AI-generated questions correctly:
  - Multiple choice questions with single/multi-select support
  - Shortform questions with acceptable answer variations
  - Code questions with basic validation
  - Explanation questions with word count requirements
  - One-liner questions with concise answer checking
- Proper scoring and feedback generation for generated content
- Integration with existing evaluation pipeline

**Verification**:
- Generated multi-question katas evaluate correctly
- All question types work with existing evaluation logic
- Scoring and feedback systems function properly
- Integration tests verify evaluation compatibility

### ✅ 6. UI Component Display Compatibility

**Requirement**: Validate that all generated kata types display correctly in existing UI components

**Implementation**:
- Generated code katas work with existing CodeEditorPanel
- Generated explanation katas display properly in StatementPanel
- Generated template katas integrate with existing kata display system
- Generated multi-question katas render correctly in MultiQuestionPanel
- Generated shortform katas work with ShortformAnswerPanel
- Proper metadata display in KataSelector and ProgressDisplay
- Integration with existing kata loading and selection system

**Verification**:
- All generated kata types display correctly in existing UI
- Metadata renders properly in kata selector
- Progress tracking works with generated katas
- Integration tests verify UI compatibility

## Additional Integration Enhancements

### Error Recovery Integration
- Enhanced error handling with retry mechanisms
- Integration with existing error notification system
- Proper error context for debugging and user feedback
- Graceful degradation when AI services are unavailable

### File System Integration
- Generated katas save to existing kata directory structure
- Proper slug generation and conflict resolution
- Integration with existing kata loading system
- File validation and error handling

### Progress and History Integration
- Generation history tracking with existing database
- Token usage and cost tracking
- Progress indicators using existing UI patterns
- Integration with existing progress display system

### Settings and Configuration Integration
- AI configuration integrated with existing settings system
- Secure API key storage using existing infrastructure
- Model selection and parameter configuration
- Validation and testing of API connectivity
