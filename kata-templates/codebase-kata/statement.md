# Analyze the Codebase: [Project Name]

## Task

Analyze the provided codebase and write a structured explanation of what the code does, how it's organized, and how the different components work together.

## Codebase Files

The following files make up this codebase:

<details>
<summary><strong>src/main.py</strong></summary>

```python
# Example main file - replace with actual codebase files
def main():
    print("Hello, World!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>src/utils.py</strong></summary>

```python
# Example utility file - replace with actual codebase files
def helper_function():
    return "Helper result"
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>config/settings.yaml</strong></summary>

```yaml
# Example config file - replace with actual codebase files
app:
  name: "Example App"
  version: "1.0.0"
```

</details>

## Analysis Requirements

Your analysis should include the following sections:

### 1. **Project Overview**
- What is the main purpose of this codebase?
- What type of application/system is it?
- What problem does it solve?

### 2. **Architecture & Structure**
- How is the code organized?
- What are the main modules/components?
- How do the different parts interact?

### 3. **Key Components**
- Identify and explain the most important files/classes/functions
- What role does each component play?
- How do they work together?

### 4. **Data Flow**
- How does data move through the system?
- What are the main inputs and outputs?
- Are there any important transformations?

### 5. **Configuration & Dependencies**
- What external dependencies does the project use?
- How is the application configured?
- Are there any environment-specific settings?

### 6. **Potential Improvements**
- What could be improved in this codebase?
- Are there any code quality issues?
- What would you change or refactor?
