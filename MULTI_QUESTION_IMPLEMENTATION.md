## Evaluation System

### Multi-Question Scoring
```typescript
// Example evaluation result
{
  success: true,
  score: 83.3,  // Percentage score
  output: "Answered 5 out of 6 questions correctly. Score: 83.3% (5/6 points). Passed!",
  testResults: [
    {
      name: "Question: Which are programming languages?",
      passed: true,
      message: "Correct!",
      expected: "a, c",
      actual: ["a", "c"]
    },
    // ... more question results
  ]
}
```

### Scoring Features
- **Weighted Points**: Questions can have different point values
- **Percentage Calculation**: Final score as percentage of total possible points
- **Pass/Fail Logic**: Configurable passing threshold (default: 70%)
- **Detailed Feedback**: Individual question results plus overall summary

## CLI Support

### Creating Multi-Question Katas
```bash
# Create a new multi-question kata
npm run new-kata my-quiz --type multi-question --difficulty medium --title "My Comprehensive Quiz"
```

### Generated Structure
```
katas/my-quiz/
├── meta.yaml          # Contains multiQuestion configuration
├── statement.md       # Quiz introduction and instructions
├── answer.md          # Entry file (UI handles actual input)
└── solution.md        # Optional reference answers
```

## Example Katas

### 1. JavaScript Fundamentals Quiz
- **Location**: `katas/javascript-fundamentals/`
- **Questions**: 5 mixed-type questions
- **Topics**: Data types, variables, arrays, type system
- **Passing Score**: 75%

### 2. Template Multi-Question Kata
- **Location**: `kata-templates/multi-question-kata/`
- **Purpose**: Template for creating new multi-question katas
- **Features**: Example of all question types with proper configuration

## Backward Compatibility

### Legacy Support
- **Single-Question Katas**: Still fully supported
- **Automatic Detection**: System detects multi-question vs single-question config
- **Graceful Fallback**: Falls back to single-question UI if no multi-question config

### Migration Path
- Existing shortform katas continue to work unchanged
- Can be upgraded to multi-question format by adding `multiQuestion` config
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Technical Implementation

### Type System Extensions
```typescript
// New interfaces
interface MultiQuestionConfig {
  title?: string
  description?: string
  questions: ShortformQuestion[]
  passingScore?: number
  showProgressBar?: boolean
  allowReview?: boolean
}

interface ShortformQuestion {
  id: string
  type: 'shortform' | 'multiple-choice' | 'one-liner'
  question: string
  points?: number
  explanation?: string
  // Type-specific fields...
}
```

### Service Layer
- **Multi-Question Evaluation**: New evaluation method in ShortformEvaluatorService
- **Question-Level Evaluation**: Individual question evaluation with aggregated results
- **Validation System**: Comprehensive validation for multi-question configurations

### UI Components
- **MultiQuestionPanel**: Main component for multi-question interface
- **Conditional Rendering**: App automatically chooses single vs multi-question UI
- **State Management**: Handles complex answer state across multiple questions

## Benefits

### For Learners
1. **Comprehensive Assessment**: Test multiple concepts in one session
2. **Better Flow**: Logical progression through related topics
3. **Efficient Learning**: Less context switching between katas
4. **Review Capability**: Check answers before final submission

### For Content Creators
1. **Efficient Creation**: One kata covers multiple concepts
2. **Flexible Structure**: Mix question types as needed
3. **Easy Management**: Single file manages entire quiz
4. **Rich Configuration**: Fine-grained control over behavior

### For the Platform
1. **Reduced Clutter**: Fewer individual kata files needed
2. **Better Organization**: Related questions grouped together
3. **Enhanced Analytics**: More detailed progress tracking
4. **Scalable Architecture**: Easy to add new question types

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Programming Concepts Quiz
```bash
npm run new-kata programming-concepts --type multi-question --title "Programming Fundamentals"
```

Then edit the `meta.yaml` to include questions about:
- Variable types (multiple choice)
- Algorithm complexity (shortform)
- Design principles (one-liner)
- Best practices (multiple choice)

### Creating a Language-Specific Assessment
```bash
npm run new-kata python-basics --type multi-question --title "Python Basics Quiz"
```

Include questions covering:
- Data structures (multiple choice)
- Syntax rules (shortform)
- Library functions (one-liner)
- Code analysis (multiple choice)

## Future Extensibility

The multi-question system is designed for easy extension:

1. **New Question Types**: Add new types to `ShortformQuestion.type`
2. **Enhanced UI**: Add new input components for different question types
3. **Advanced Scoring**: Implement more complex scoring algorithms
4. **Question Dependencies**: Add conditional questions based on previous answers
5. **Time Limits**: Add per-question or overall time constraints

The modular architecture ensures that new features can be added without breaking existing functionality.

## Summary

The multi-question implementation successfully transforms shortform katas from single-question exercises into comprehensive, multi-faceted assessments. This enhancement provides:

- **Better Learning Experiences**: More comprehensive and engaging assessments
- **Improved Efficiency**: Reduced kata management overhead
- **Enhanced Flexibility**: Mix different question types as needed
- **Maintained Simplicity**: Easy to create and configure
- **Full Backward Compatibility**: No disruption to existing katas

The system is now ready to support rich, multi-question learning experiences while maintaining the simplicity and effectiveness of the original shortform kata concept.
