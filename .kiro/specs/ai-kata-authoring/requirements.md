# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating an AI-powered automated authoring system for the Code Kata Electron App that allows users to generate complete kata structures by simply describing the type of kata or quiz they want. The system will use OpenAI's API to generate all necessary files including problem statements, starter code, test cases, and metadata based on natural language descriptions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a kata creator, I want to describe a coding challenge in natural language and have the AI generate a complete kata structure, so that I can quickly create new challenges without manually writing all the boilerplate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens the AI authoring interface THEN the system SHALL display a text input for kata description
2. WHEN a user enters a kata description THEN the system SHALL provide options for language, difficulty, and kata type
3. WHEN a user clicks "Generate Kata" THEN the system SHALL send the description to OpenAI API with appropriate prompts
4. WHEN the AI generates content THEN the system SHALL create all required files (meta.yaml, statement.md, entry file, tests file)
5. IF the generation fails THEN the system SHALL display error messages and allow retry

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a kata creator, I want the AI to generate appropriate starter code, test cases, and solution files for different programming languages and kata types, so that the generated katas are immediately usable and properly structured.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating a Python kata THEN the system SHALL create entry.py with function stubs, tests.py with pytest-compatible tests, and solution.py with working implementation
2. WHEN generating a JavaScript kata THEN the system SHALL create entry.js with function exports, tests.js with proper test structure, and solution.js with working implementation
3. WHEN generating a TypeScript kata THEN the system SHALL create entry.ts with typed functions, tests.ts with type-safe tests, and solution.ts with working implementation
4. WHEN generating a C++ kata THEN the system SHALL create entry.cpp with function declarations, appropriate test structure, and solution.cpp with working implementation
5. WHEN generating hidden tests THEN the system SHALL create additional test cases that are more comprehensive than public tests
6. WHEN generating solutions THEN the system SHALL ensure the solution passes all generated test cases including hidden tests
7. WHEN generating shortform katas THEN the system SHALL create proper multiQuestion configuration with appropriate question types
8. WHEN generating multi-question katas THEN the system SHALL create comprehensive assessments with mixed question types (multiple-choice, shortform, one-liner, code, explanation)
9. WHEN generating multiple-choice katas THEN the system SHALL create questions with plausible distractors and proper option structures
10. WHEN generating one-liner katas THEN the system SHALL create fill-in-the-blank or completion-style questions with acceptable answer variations

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a kata creator, I want the AI to generate explanation, template, and assessment katas with proper rubrics and solutions, so that I can create diverse types of learning challenges beyond just coding problems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating an explanation kata THEN the system SHALL create statement.md with clear explanation requirements
2. WHEN generating an explanation kata THEN the system SHALL create rubric.yaml with appropriate scoring criteria and solution.md with exemplar answer
3. WHEN generating a template kata THEN the system SHALL create statement.md describing the project structure to build
4. WHEN generating a template kata THEN the system SHALL create rubric.yaml with structure and best practice criteria and solution files showing expected structure
5. WHEN generating template katas THEN the system SHALL include example folder structures and configuration files in the solution
6. WHEN generating codebase katas THEN the system SHALL create analysis-focused challenges with existing code to examine
7. WHEN generating comprehensive exam katas THEN the system SHALL create multi-question assessments covering broad topic areas

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a kata creator, I want to preview and edit the AI-generated content before saving, so that I can ensure quality and make adjustments to match my specific requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AI generation completes THEN the system SHALL display a preview of all generated files
2. WHEN previewing content THEN the system SHALL allow editing of each file before saving
3. WHEN a user modifies generated content THEN the system SHALL track changes and allow reverting to original
4. WHEN a user approves the kata THEN the system SHALL save all files to the katas directory
5. IF a kata with the same slug exists THEN the system SHALL prompt for confirmation before overwriting

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a kata creator, I want to specify additional constraints and requirements for the AI generation, so that I can create more targeted and specific challenges.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN describing a kata THEN the system SHALL allow specifying topics, algorithms, or concepts to focus on
2. WHEN setting difficulty THEN the system SHALL adjust complexity of generated problems accordingly
3. WHEN specifying constraints THEN the system SHALL include time/space complexity requirements in generated problems
4. WHEN adding tags THEN the system SHALL incorporate relevant tags into the generated meta.yaml
5. WHEN requesting specific test scenarios THEN the system SHALL include those scenarios in generated test cases

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the AI authoring system to handle API errors gracefully and provide clear feedback, so that I can understand what went wrong and how to fix it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN OpenAI API is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message with retry option
2. WHEN API rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL show appropriate waiting time and retry automatically
3. WHEN API responses are malformed THEN the system SHALL attempt to parse partial content and request regeneration
4. WHEN network connectivity fails THEN the system SHALL cache the request and retry when connection is restored
5. IF API key is invalid or missing THEN the system SHALL provide clear instructions for configuration

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a kata creator, I want to generate variations of existing katas, so that I can create series of related challenges with increasing difficulty.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN selecting an existing kata THEN the system SHALL offer "Generate Variation" option
2. WHEN generating variations THEN the system SHALL maintain the core concept while changing parameters
3. WHEN creating difficulty progressions THEN the system SHALL adjust complexity appropriately
4. WHEN generating series THEN the system SHALL create consistent naming and tagging across related katas
5. WHEN variations are created THEN the system SHALL suggest logical ordering for learning progression

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a kata creator, I want the AI to generate comprehensive multi-question assessments and shortform quizzes, so that I can create efficient knowledge checks and comprehensive evaluations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating multi-question katas THEN the system SHALL create assessments with configurable passing scores and progress tracking
2. WHEN creating multi-question assessments THEN the system SHALL support mixing different question types within a single kata
3. WHEN generating shortform questions THEN the system SHALL create concise questions with multiple acceptable answer variations
4. WHEN creating multiple-choice questions THEN the system SHALL generate plausible distractors and support both single and multi-select formats
5. WHEN generating one-liner questions THEN the system SHALL create fill-in-the-blank or completion-style questions
6. WHEN creating code questions within assessments THEN the system SHALL generate language-specific coding challenges with starter code
7. WHEN generating explanation questions THEN the system SHALL create open-ended questions with minimum word requirements and rubrics
8. WHEN creating assessment configurations THEN the system SHALL include proper scoring weights, explanations, and review capabilities
