# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a cloud synchronization system for the Code Kata Electron App that allows users to connect their Google Drive account and automatically sync their katas across different devices. The system will handle bidirectional synchronization, conflict resolution, and offline capabilities while maintaining the local-first approach of the application.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using multiple devices, I want to connect my Google Drive account to sync my katas, so that I can access my coding challenges and progress from any device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens sync settings THEN the system SHALL display Google Drive connection options
2. WHEN a user clicks "Connect Google Drive" THEN the system SHALL initiate OAuth2 authentication flow
3. WHEN authentication completes THEN the system SHALL store secure access tokens and display connection status
4. WHEN connection is established THEN the system SHALL create a dedicated "CodeKataApp" folder in Google Drive
5. IF authentication fails THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages and retry options

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want my katas to be automatically backed up to Google Drive when I create or modify them, so that my work is always preserved in the cloud.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new kata is created locally THEN the system SHALL upload it to Google Drive within 30 seconds
2. WHEN an existing kata is modified THEN the system SHALL sync the changes to Google Drive
3. WHEN a kata is deleted locally THEN the system SHALL move it to a "Deleted" folder in Google Drive
4. WHEN sync operations occur THEN the system SHALL show sync status indicators in the UI
5. IF upload fails THEN the system SHALL queue the operation for retry when connection is restored

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user switching between devices, I want to download katas from Google Drive that don't exist locally, so that I can access my full kata collection on any device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL check Google Drive for new or updated katas
2. WHEN new katas are found in Google Drive THEN the system SHALL download them to the local katas directory
3. WHEN kata updates are detected THEN the system SHALL sync the latest version to local storage
4. WHEN sync completes THEN the system SHALL refresh the kata selector to show all available katas
5. IF download fails THEN the system SHALL log errors and retry on next sync cycle

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to handle conflicts when the same kata is modified on different devices, so that I don't lose work due to synchronization issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a conflict is detected THEN the system SHALL create backup copies of both versions
2. WHEN conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL present a conflict resolution interface
3. WHEN resolving conflicts THEN the system SHALL allow choosing between local, remote, or merged versions
4. WHEN conflicts are resolved THEN the system SHALL sync the chosen version to all devices
5. IF automatic resolution fails THEN the system SHALL preserve both versions with clear naming

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to sync my progress and attempt history across devices, so that my learning progress is consistent everywhere.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN progress is updated locally THEN the system SHALL sync attempt history to Google Drive
2. WHEN switching devices THEN the system SHALL download and merge progress data
3. WHEN progress conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL merge attempt histories intelligently
4. WHEN syncing progress THEN the system SHALL preserve best scores and completion status
5. IF progress sync fails THEN the system SHALL maintain local progress and retry sync later

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to work offline and have my changes sync when I reconnect, so that network connectivity doesn't interrupt my coding practice.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN network is unavailable THEN the system SHALL continue working with local katas
2. WHEN changes are made offline THEN the system SHALL queue them for sync when online
3. WHEN connection is restored THEN the system SHALL automatically sync queued changes
4. WHEN offline changes conflict with remote changes THEN the system SHALL apply conflict resolution
5. IF sync queue becomes large THEN the system SHALL prioritize recent changes and user-created content

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want to control what gets synced and manage my cloud storage usage, so that I can optimize sync behavior for my needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing sync settings THEN the system SHALL show sync preferences and storage usage
2. WHEN configuring sync THEN the system SHALL allow enabling/disabling sync for different data types
3. WHEN managing storage THEN the system SHALL show cloud storage usage and cleanup options
4. WHEN sync is disabled THEN the system SHALL stop all sync operations but preserve local data
5. IF storage quota is exceeded THEN the system SHALL notify user and suggest cleanup actions

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see sync status and history, so that I can understand what's being synced and troubleshoot any issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing sync status THEN the system SHALL show last sync time and current sync state
2. WHEN sync operations occur THEN the system SHALL display progress indicators and operation details
3. WHEN viewing sync history THEN the system SHALL show recent sync operations and their results
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for troubleshooting
5. IF sync issues persist THEN the system SHALL provide diagnostic information and support options

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a user, I want to disconnect from Google Drive and clean up synced data, so that I can stop using the sync feature if needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN disconnecting from Google Drive THEN the system SHALL revoke access tokens securely
2. WHEN disconnection occurs THEN the system SHALL preserve all local data and stop sync operations
3. WHEN requested THEN the system SHALL provide option to delete cloud data during disconnection
4. WHEN cleanup is selected THEN the system SHALL remove the CodeKataApp folder from Google Drive
5. IF disconnection fails THEN the system SHALL provide manual cleanup instructions
